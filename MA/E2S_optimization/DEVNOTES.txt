% NOTES FOR TRAJECTORY OPTIMIZER
% Always work with NON-DIMENSIONAL quantities
% 1) Interplanetary trajectory optimizer: given flybys sequence from Tisserand's analysis
%    a) Variables of the problems: Encounter timings, DSM timing and magnitude
%       (1 per two body problem arc, parameterized with spherical/cylindrical coordinates
%       to avoid explicit time dependence of the optimum). Flyby powered manoeuvre at perigee (magnitude only)
% 2) Saturn's system tour --> Enceladus orbit:
%    a) Branch and Bound algorithm to obtain multiple flybys combinations
%    b) For each combination --> trajectory optimizer working on timings, TCMs timings and magnitudes
%       (V-inf leveraging)
